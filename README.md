# Timelapse-Arduino-Software
This is the Arduino software for controlling the Timelapse Camera Slider project that we developed.

The software controls a motor for making a camera move along a slide. It controls a display with a meny-system and it triggs the camera to take a picture. There's also functionality for reading and displaying the amount of battery left.
